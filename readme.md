This repo consists of a pair of simple scripts to programmatically write days of the week over the "It's Wednesday, or as I like to call it:" meme.

1. Use `scribbles.py` to generate the set of scribbles you want to use to scribble out successive days of the week on the image.
2. Use `main.py` to produce your image.
